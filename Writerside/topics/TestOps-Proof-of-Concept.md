# TestOps

TestOps, short for Testing Operations, is a discipline that integrates the practices of software testing and operations. It focuses on the processes, tools, and methodologies needed to manage and optimize the testing lifecycle within the broader context of software development and delivery. TestOps aims to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and collaboration of testing activities to ensure high-quality software releases.

## The Proof of Concept

Through the development of a proof-of-concept, we have shown how to integrate TestOps strategies and tools into an existing application, more specifically into its CI/CD pipeline, which is an integral part of the DevOps cycle. For the integration, we chose a free and open-source note-taking application with various functionalities and tools to help users organise, edit and access their notes, called Nowted. The application is built using Next.js (a web framework), Tailwind CSS (a style framework) and Zustand (a state management tool). We chose this application to be as close to the real world as possible (largely due to the technologies used, which are currently popular) and to implement TestOps strategies and tools as we would in the enterprise.
